        <h1>Early History of Machine Learning</h1>

    <article><p>The first case of neural networks was in 1943, when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper about neurons, and how they work. They decided to create a model of this using an electrical circuit, and therefore the neural network was born.

    <p>Another extremely early instance of a neural network came in 1959, when Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff created two models of them at Stanford University. The first was called ADELINE, and it could detect binary patterns. For example, in a stream of bits, it could predict what the next one would be. The next generation was called MADELINE, and it could eliminate echo on phone lines, so had a useful real world application. It is still in use today.</p>
